# Vagrant + Ansible Example

## Why Vagrant

It helps to quickly provision local VMs for experiments like this one. 

Vagrant is **not** needed with Ansible.

## Steps 

 - Install ansible (mac: brew install ansible, Windows?...)
 - Vagrant is a tool for provisioning VMs locally for experimentation and development
 - Install vagrant to provision a few VMs locally
 - Use vagrant init to create a Vagrantfile
 - Use minimal/xenial64 as the "box"
